The thing to remeber about Java is the importance on the use of objects.
Objects are the reason that Java is implemented so widely in the world.
Objects allow the programmer to store and change across a variety of 
situations. The objects themselves are made of the most basic forms of 
data structures, but combined in the most creative way yields a result
that can change the way we code entirely.
